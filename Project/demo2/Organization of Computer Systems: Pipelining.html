</p><h3>5.1. Overview of Pipelining </h3>

<a name="Sec5.1"></a>
<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec5.1"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Recall that, in Section 4, we designed a multicycle datapath based
on (a) building blocks such as multiplexers for selecting an operation
to produce ALU output, (b) ALUs to compute addresses and arithmetic or
logical operations, and (c) components such as memories or registers for
long- or short-term storage of operands or results.  We also showed that
the multicycle datapath is, in practice, more efficient than the single-cycle
datapath.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In this section, we continue our quest for efficient
computation by discovering that we can overlay single-cycle datapaths
in time to produce a type of computational architecture called
<i>pipelining</i>.  We show that pipelined architectures, when they
work properly and are relatively free from errors and hazards such as
dependencies, stalls, or exceptions can outperform a simple multicycle
datapath.  Also, we discuss problems associated with pipelining that
limits its usefulness in various types of computations.

</p><h4>5.1.1. Concept of Pipelining</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Suppose you wanted to make an automobile from
scratch.  You might gather up the raw materials, form the metal into
recognizeable shapes, cast some of the metal into an engine block,
connect up fuel lines, wires, etc., to eventually (one would hope)
make a workable automobile.  To do this, you would need many skills -
all the skills of the artisans that make autos, and management skills
in addition to being an electrician and a metallurgist.  This would
not be an efficient way to make a car, but would definitely provide
many challenges.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">That is the way a multicycle datapath works - it is
designed to do everything - input, output, and computation (recall the
fetch-decode-execute sequence).  We need to ask ourselves if this is
really the best way to compute efficiently, especially when we
consider the complexity of control for large (CISC) systems or even
smaller RISC processors.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, our analogy with car-making is not so
far-fetched, and can actually help us arrive at a more efficient
processor design.  Consider the modern way of making cars - on an
<i>assembly line</i>.  Here, there is an orderly flow of parts down a
conveyor belt, and the parts are processed by different stations (also
called <i>segments</i> of the assembly line).  Each segment does one
thing, over and over.  The segments are coordinated to exploit the
<i>sequentiality</i> inherent in the automobile assembly process.  The
work gets done more smoothly (because of the orderly flow of input
parts and output results), more efficiently (because each assembler at
each segment of the pipeline does his or her task at what one hopes
is maximum efficiency), and more reliably because there is greater
consistency in one task being done repetitively (provided the
assembly line is designed correctly).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">A similar analogy exists for computers.  Instead of a
multicycle datapath with its complex control system that walks, talks,
cries, and computes - let us suppose that we could build an
<i>assembly line for computing</i>.  Such objects actually exist, and
they are called <i>pipeline processors</i>.  They have
sequentially-arranged stages or segments, each of which perform a
specific task in a fixed amount of time.  Data flows through these
pipelines like cars through an assembly line.

</p><h4>5.1.2. Definitions and Practical Observations about Pipelines</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We next consider several terms and some practical
issues associated with pipeline processors.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.1.2.1. Definition.</b>  A <i>pipeline processor</i>
is comprised of a sequential, linear list of <i>segments</i>, where each
segment performs one computational task or group of tasks.   

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.1.2.2. Observation.</b> A pipeline processor can
be represented in two dimensions, as shown in Figure 5.1.  Here, the
pipeline segments (Seg #1 through Seg #3) are arranged vertically, so
the data can flow from the input at the top left downward to the
output of the pipeline (after Segment 3).  The progress of an
instruction is charted in blue typeface, and the next instruction is
shown in red typeface.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">There are three things that one must observe about
the pipeline.  First, the work (in a computer, the ISA) is divided up
into pieces that more or less fit into the segments alloted for them.
Second, this implies that in order for the pipeline to work
efficiently and smoothly, the work partitions must each take about the
same time to complete.  Otherwise, the longest partition requiring
time T would hold up the pipeline, and every segment would have to
take time T to complete its work.  For fast segments, this would mean
much idle time.  Third, in order for the pipeline to work smoothly,
there must be few (if any) exceptions or hazards that cause errors or
delays within the pipeline.  Otherwise, the instruction will have to
be reloaded and the pipeline restarted with the same instruction that
causes the exception.  There are additional problems we need to discuss
about  pipeline processors, which we will consider shortly.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="Organization%20of%20Computer%20Systems:%20Pipelining_files/Figure5.html"><br><br>
<b>Figure 5.1.</b> Notional diagram of a pipeline processor.
The segments are arranged vertically, and time moves along the horizontal
axis.  </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.1.2.3. Reponse Time.</b>  It is easily verified,
through inspection of Figure 5.1., that the response time for any 
instruction that takes three segments must be three times the response
time for any segment, <i>provided that the pipeline was full when
the instruction was loaded into the pipeline</i>.  As we shall
see later in this section, if an N-segment pipeline is empty before an
instruction starts, then N + (N-1) cycles or segments of the pipeline
are required to execute the instruction, because it takes N cycles to
fill the pipe.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Note that we just used the term "cycle" and "segment"
synonomously.  In the type of pipelines that we will study in this
course (which includes the vast majority of pipeline processors), each
segment takes one cycle to complete its work.  Thus, an N-segment
pipeline takes a minimum time of N cycles to execute one instruction.
This brings to mind the performance issues discussed in Section
5.1.1.5.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.1.2.4. Work Partitioning.</b>  In the previous
section, we designed a multicycle datapath based on the assumption that
computational work associated with the execution of an instruction could
be partitioned into a five-step process, as follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="Organization%20of%20Computer%20Systems:%20Pipelining_files/MIPS-PipelineSteps.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.1.2.5. Performance.</b> Because there are N
segments active in the pipeline at any one time (when it is full), 
it is thus possible to execute N segments concurrently in any cycle
of the pipeline.  In contrast, a purely sequential implementation of
the fetch-decode-execute cycle would require N cycles for the longest
instruction.  Thus, it can be said that we have <b>O</b>(N) speedup.
As we shall see when we analyze pipeline performance, an exact
N-fold speedup does not always occur in practice.  However it is 
sufficient to say that the speedup is of order N.

</p><h3>5.2. Pipeline Datapath Design and Implementation</h3>

<a name="Sec5.2"></a>
<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec5.2"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">As shown in Section 5.1.2.4, the work involved in
an instruction can be partitioned into steps labelled IF (Instruction
Fetch), ID (Instruction Decode and data fetch), EX (ALU operations or
R-format execution), MEM (Memory operations), and WB (Write-Back to
register file).  We next discuss how this sequence of steps can
be implemented in terms of MIPS instructions.

</p><h4>5.2.1. MIPS Instructions and Pipelining</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In order to implement MIPS instructions effectively
on a pipeline processor, we must ensure that the instructions are the
same length (<i>simplicity favors regularity</i>) for easy IF and ID,
similar to the multicycle datapath.  We also need to have few but
consistent instruction formats, to avoid deciphering variable formats
during IF and ID, which would prohibitively increase pipeline segment
complexity for those tasks.  Thus, the register indices should be in
the same place in each instruction.  In practice, this means that the
<i>rd</i>, <i>rs</i>, and <i>rt</i> fields of the MIPS instruction
must not change location across all MIPS pipeline instructions.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Additionally, we want to have instruction decoding
and reading of the register contents occur at the same time, which is
supported by the datapath architecture that we have designed thus far.
Observe that we have memory address computation in the <code>lw</code>
and <code>sw</code> instructions only, and that these are the only
instructions in our five-instruction MIPS subset that perform memory
operations.  As before, we assume that operands are aligned in memory,
for straightforward access.

</p><h4>5.2.2. Datapath Partitioning for Pipelining</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Recall the single-cycle datapath, which can be
partitioned (subdivided) into functional units as shown in Figure 5.2.
Because the single-cycle datapath contains separate Instruction
Memory and Data Memory units, this allows us to directly implement in
hardware the IF-ID-EX-MEM-WB representation of the MIPS instruction
sequence.  Observe that several control lines have been added, for
example, to route data from the ALU output (or memory output) to the
register file for writing.  Also, there are again three ALUs, one for
ALUop, another for JTA computation, and a third for adding PC+4 to
compute the address of the next instruction.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="Organization%20of%20Computer%20Systems:%20Pipelining_files/Figure5_006.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 5.2.</b> Partitioning of the MIPS single-cycle datapath
developed previously, to form a pipeline processor.
The segments are arranged horizontally, and data flows from left
to right [Maf01,MK98].</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can represent this pipeline structure using a
space-time diagram similar to Figure 5.1, as shown in Figure 5.3.
Here four load instructions are executed sequentially, which are
chosen because the <code>lw</code> instruction is the only one in our
MIPS subset that consistently utilizes all five pipeline segments.
Observe also that the right half of the register file is shaded to
represent a read operation, while the left half is shaded to represent
write.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="Organization%20of%20Computer%20Systems:%20Pipelining_files/Figure5_005.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 5.3.</b> Partitioning of the MIPS single-cycle datapath
developed previously, with replication in space, to form a pipeline
processor that computes four <code>lw</code> instructions.  The
segments are arranged horizontally, and data flows from left to right,
synchronously with the clock cycles (CC1 through CC7)
[Maf01,MK98].</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In order to ensure that the single-cycle datapath
conforms to the pipeline design constraint of one cycle per segment,
we need to add buffers and control between stages, similar to the
way we added buffers in the multicycle datapath.  These buffers
and control circuitry are shown in Figure 5.4 as red rectangles,
and store the results of the i-th stage so that the (i+1)-th stage
can use these results in the next clock cycle.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="Organization%20of%20Computer%20Systems:%20Pipelining_files/Figure5_008.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 5.4.</b> Addition of control and buffer circuits to 
Figure 5.3 produces the MIPS pipelined datapath [Maf01,MK98].</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In summary, pipelining improves efficiency by first
regularizing the instruction format, for simplicity.  We then divide
the instructions into a fixed number of steps, and implement each step
as a pipeline segment.  During the pipeline design phase, we ensure
that each segment takes about the same amount of time to execute as
other segments in the pipeline.  Also, we want to keep the pipeline
full wherever possible, in order to maximize utilization and
throughput, while minimizing set-up time.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In the next section, we will see that pipeline
processing has some difficult problems, which are called <i>hazards</i>,
and the pipeline is also susceptible to exceptions.

</p><h3>5.3. Pipeline Control and Hazards </h3>

<a name="Sec5.3"></a>
<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec5.3"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The control of pipeline processors has similar issues
to the control of multicycle datapaths.  Pipelining leaves the meaning
of the nine control lines unchanged, that is, those lines which
controlled the multicycle datapath.  In pipelining, we set control
lines (to defined values) in each stage for each instruction.  This is
done in hardware by extending pipeline registers to include control
information and circuitry.

</p><h4>5.3.1. Pipeline Control Issues and Hardware</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Observe that there is nothing to
control during instruction fetch and decode (IF and ID).  Thus, we can
begin our control activities (initialization of control signals)
during ID, since control will only be exerted during EX, MEM, and WB
stages of the pipeline.  Recalling that the various stages of control
and buffer circuitry between the pipeline stages are labelled IF/ID,
ID/EX, EX/MEM, and MEM/WB, we have the propagation of control shown
in Figure 5.5.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="Organization%20of%20Computer%20Systems:%20Pipelining_files/Figure5_003.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 5.5.</b> Propagation of control through the EX, MEM, and
WB states of the MIPS pipelined datapath [Maf01,MK98].</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the following stages perform work as specified:

</p><p></p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>IF/ID</i>: Initializes control by
       passing the <i>rs</i>, <i>rd</i>, and <i>rt</i> fields of the
       instruction, together with the opcode and <i>funct</i> fields,
       to the control circuitry.

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>ID/EX</i>: Buffers control for the EX,
       MEM, and WB stages, while executing control for the EX stage.
       Control decides what operands will be input to the ALU,
       what ALU operation will be performed, and whether or not a
       branch is to be taken based on the ALU Zero output.

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>EX/MEM</i>: Buffers control for the MEM
       and WB stages, while executing control for the MEM stage.  The
       control lines are set for memory read or write, as well as for
       data selection for memory write.  This stage of control also
       contains the branch control logic.

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>MEM/WB</i>: Buffers and executes control
       for the WB stage, and selects the value to be written into the
       register file.
</p></li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Figure 5.6 shows how the control lines (red) are
arranged on a per-stage basis, and how the stage-specific control
signals are buffered and passed along to the next applicable stage.

<h4>5.3.2. Overview of Hazards</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Pipeline processors have several problems associated
with controlling smooth, efficient execution of instructions on the
pipeline.  These problems are generally called <i>hazards</i>, and
include the following three types:

</p><p></p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Structural Hazards</i> occur when
           different instructions collide while trying to access the
           same piece of hardware in the same segment of a pipeline.
           This type of hazard can be alleviated by having redundant
           hardware for the segments wherein the collision occurs.
	   Occasionally, it is possible to insert stalls or reorder
	   instructions to omit this type of hazard.

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Data Hazards</i> occur when an instruction
           depends on the result of a previous instruction still in
           the pipeline, which result has not yet been computed.  The
	   simplest remedy inserts stalls in the execution sequence,
	   which reduces the pipeline's efficiency.  The solution to
	   data dependencies is twofold.  First, one can <i>forward</i>
	   the ALU result to the writeback or data fetch stages.  Second,
	   in selected instances, it is possible to restructure the code
	   to eliminate some data dependencies.  Forwarding paths are
	   shown as thin blue or red lines in Figure 5.4.

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Control Hazards</i> can result from branch
           instructions.  Here, the branch target address might not be
           ready in time for the branch to be taken, which results in
           <i>stalls</i> (dead segments) in the pipeline that have to
           be inserted as local wait events, until processing can
           resume after the branch target is executed.  Control
           hazards can be mitigated through accurate branch prediction
           (which is difficult), and by <i>delayed branch</i>
           strategies.
</p></li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We next examine hazards in detail, and discuss several
techniques for eliminating or relieving hazards.

</p><h4>5.3.3. Data Hazards</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Definition.</b> A <i>data hazard</i> occurs when the
current instruction requires the result of a preceding instruction,
but there are insufficient segments in the pipeline to compute the
result and write it back to the register file in time for the current
instruction to read that result from the register file.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">We typically remedy this problem in one of three ways:

</p><p></p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Forwarding</i>: In order to resolve a
         dependency, one adds special circuitry to the pipeline that
         is comprised of wires and switches with which one forwards
         or transmits the desired value to the pipeline segment that
         needs that value for computation.  Although this adds hardware
	 and control circuitry, the method works because it takes far
	 less time for the required value(s) to travel through a wire
	 than it does for a pipeline segment to compute its result.

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Code Re-Ordering</i>: Here, the compiler
         reorders statements in the source code, or the assembler
         reorders object code, to place one or more statements between
         the current instruction and the instruction in which the
         required operand was computed as a result.  This requires an
         "intelligent" compiler or assembler, which must have detailed
         information about the structure and timing of the pipeline on
         which the data hazard would occur.  We call this type of
         software a <i>hardware-dependent compiler</i>.

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Stall Insertion</i>: It is possible to
         insert one or more stalls (no-op instructions) into the pipeline,
	 which delays the execution of the current instruction until the
	 required operand is written to the register file.  This decreases
	 pipeline efficiency and throughput, which is contrary to the
	 goals of pipeline processor design.  Stalls are an expedient method
	 of last resort that can be used when compiler action or forwarding
	 fails or might not be supported in hardware or software design.


</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The following example is illustrative.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example.</b> Suppose we have the following
sequence of instructions:

</p><pre>     sub   $2,   $1,   $3   # Register 2 is the output of sub
     and   $8,   $2,   $5   # Operand #1 depends on Register 2 data
     or    $9,   $6,   $2   # Operand #2 depends on Register 2 data
     add   $7,   $2,   $2   # Add result depends on Register 2 data
     sw    $6,20($2)        # Store (memory write) depends on Register 2
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">whose pipeline scheduling diagram is shown in Figure
5.7.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="Organization%20of%20Computer%20Systems:%20Pipelining_files/Figure5_007.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 5.7.</b> Example of data hazards in a sequence of MIPS
instructions, where the red (blue) arrows indicate dependencies
that are problematic (not problematic) [Pat98,MK98].</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Problem</i>: The first instruction
(<code>sub</code>), starting on clock cycle 1 (CC1) completes on CC5,
when the result in Register 2 is written to the register file.  If we
did nothing to resolve data dependencies, then no instruction that
read Register 2 from the register file could read the "new" value
computed by the sub instruction until CC5.  The dependencies in the
other instructions are illustrated by solid lines with arrowheads.  If
register read and write cannot occur within the same clock cycle (we
will see how this could happen in Section 5.3.4), then only the fifth
instruction (sw) can access the contents of register 2 in the manner
indicated by the flow of sequential execution in the MIPS code
fragment shown previously.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Solution #1 - Forwarding</i>: The result generated
by the <code>sub</code> instruction can be <i>forwarded</i> to the
other stages of the pipeline using special control circuitry (data
bus switchable to any other segment, which can be implemented via a
decoder or crossbar switch).  This is indicated notionally in Figure
5.7 by solid red lines with arrowheads.  If the register file can read
in the first half of a cycle and write in the second half of a cycle,
then the forwarding in CC5 is not problematic.  Otherwise, we would
have to delay the execution of the <code>add</code> instruction by one
clock cycle (see Figure 5.9 for insertion of a <i>stall</i>).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Solution #2 - Code Re-Ordering</i>: Since all
Instructions 2 through 5 in the MIPS code fragment require Register 2
as an operand, we do not have instructions <i>in that particular code
fragment</i> to put between Instruction 1 and Instruction 2.  However,
let us assume that we have other instructions that (a) do not depend
on the results of Instructions 1-5, and (b) themselves induce no
dependencies in Instructions 1-5 (e.g., by writing to register 1, 2,
3, 5, or 6).  In that case, we could insert two instructions between
Instructions 1 and 2, if register read and write could occur
concurrently.  Otherwise, we would have to insert three such
instructions.  The latter case is illustrated in the following figure,
where the inserted instructions and their pipeline actions are colored
dark green.

<b>Figure 5.8.</b> Example of code reordering to solve data hazards in a
sequence of MIPS instructions [Pat98,MK98].</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Solution #3 - Stalls</i>: Suppose that we had no
instructions to insert between Instructions 1 and 2.  For example,
there might be data dependencies arising from the inserted
instructions that would themselves have to be repaired.
Alternatively, the program execution order (functional dependencies)
might not permit the reordering of code.  In such cases, we have to
insert stalls, also called <i>bubbles</i>, which are no-op
instructions that merely delay the pipeline execution until the
dependencies are no longer problematic with respect to pipeline
timing.  This is illustrated in Figure 5.9 by inserting three stalls
between Instructions 1 and 2.

<b>Figure 5.9.</b> Example of stall insertion to solve data hazards in a
sequence of MIPS instructions [Pat98,MK98].</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As mentioned previously, the insertion of stalls
is the least desireable technique because it delays the execution of
an instruction without accomplishing any useful work (in contrast to
code re-ordering).
</p></blockquote>

<h4>5.3.4. Structural Hazards</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Definition.</b> A <i>structural hazard</i> occurs 
when there is insufficient hardware to support a computation in a
given pipeline segment.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">For example, consider the data dependency between the
first and fourth instructions (<code>sub</code> and <code>add</code>)
of the example in Section 5.3.3.  Here, a register file write and a
register file read are scheduled in CC5.  This can be resolved by (a)
duplicating hardware, or (b) modifying the existing hardware to
support concurrent operations.  If we duplicated the register
file, then we could perform concurrent read and write operations, but
there would be a <i>consistency problem</i>.  That is, at a given
clock cycle, registers in one register file could have different
values than the corresponding registers in the other register file.
This inconsistency is clearly unacceptable if accurate computation
is to be maintained.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Instead, we can modify the register file so that it
(1) performs register write on the first half of the clock cycle and
(2) performs register read on the second half of the clock cycle.  In
earlier hardware, designers sometimes inserted a delay between write
and read that was very small in relation to the clock cycle time, in
order to ensure convergence of the register file write.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Other structural hazards could occur during the
branch instruction, if there were not two ALUs in the EX segment of
the pipeline.  That is, with only one ALU, we would have to
simultaneously compute the BTA and determine (via subtraction) whether
or not the branch condition was fulfilled.  This would not be possible
without two concurrent adders in the ALU, which is what we currently
have in our MIPS pipeline design shown in Figure 5.4.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">A further structural hazard could occur if we only
used one memory for both instructions and data.  For example, in
Figure 5.7, suppose the <code>sub</code> instruction was instead
a <code>sw</code> instruction.  Then, we would be writing to data
memory in CC4 for Instruction #1 and reading from instruction memory
in CC4 for Instruction #4.  Clearly, if there was only one memory
there would be a conflict.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Similar to the problem with the concurrent reads and
writes on the register file, there are two ways to solve this dilemma.
First, we can design a special-purpose memory module that permits
writing (reading) on the first (resp. second) half of the clock cycle,
as we said could be done with the register file.  However, this
requires special (expensive) hardware.  Second, we can use two fast
caches, one for instructions, and one for data, that access a large,
slower main memory in which instructions and data are both stored.
The latter method is used in practice because caches and main memory
already exist, and the memory management hardware for these types of
components also exists.  Thus, we can use off-the-shelf hardware to
solve a problem that would otherwise require special-purpose
development of expensive hardware.  Although this might not be as much
fun as developing new hardware, it is more cost-effective, which
matters when one is designing and producing computers for profit.

</p><h4>5.3.5. Control (Branch) Hazards</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Control hazards are the most difficult types of
hazards arising from normal operation of a program.  In the next
section, we will see that exceptions (e.g., overflow) can play
particularly interesting types of havoc with smooth pipeline
execution.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The most common type of control hazard is the branch
instruction, which has two alternative results: (1) jump to the branch
target address if the instruction succeeds, or (2) execute the
instruction after the branch (at PC+4 of instruction memory) if the
branch fails.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The problem with the branch instruction is that we
usually do not know which result will occur (i.e., whether or not the
branch will be taken) until the branch condition is computed.  Often,
the branch condition depends on the result of the preceding instruction,
so we cannot precompute the branch condition to find out whether or
not the branch will be taken.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The following four strategies are employed in resolving
control dependencies due to branch instructions.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.3.5.1. Assume Branch Not Taken.</b> As we saw
previously, we can insert stalls until we find out whether or not the
branch is taken.  However, this slows pipeline execution unacceptably.
A common alternative to stalling is to continue execution of the
instruction stream as though the branch was not taken.  The
intervening instructions between the branch and its target are then
executed.  If the branch is not taken, this is not a harmful or
disruptive technique.  However, if the branch is taken, then we must
discard the results of the instructions executed after the branch
statement.  This is done by flushing the IF, ID, and EX stages of the
pipeline for the discarded instructions.  Execution continues
uninterrupted after the branch target.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The cost of this technique is approximately equal to
the cost of discarding instructions.  For example, if branches are not
taken 50 percent of the time, and the cost of discarding results is
negligible, then this technique reduces by 50 percent the cost of
control hazards.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.3.5.2. Reducing Branch Delay.</b> In the MIPS
pipeline architecture shown schematically in Figure 5.4, we currently
assume that the branch condition is evaluated in Stage 3 of the
pipeline (EX).  If we move the branch evaluation up one stage, and put
special circuitry in the ID (Decode, Stage #2), then we can evaluate
the branch condition for the <code>beq</code> instruction.  This would
allow us to take the branch in EX instead of MEM, since we would have
ready for Stage 3 (EX) the <i>Zero</i> output of the comparator that
would normally be computed in EX.  The hardware needed to compute
equality is merely a series of parallel <i>xnor</i> gates <i>and</i>-ed
together, then inverted.  

</p><blockquote>
<font color="BLUE"></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="BLUE"><i>Exercise</i>: Determine how
this type of circuitry could be configured.</font>
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The advantage of this technique is that only one
instruction needs to be discarded rather than two, as in the previous
section.  This reduces hardware cost and time required to flush the
pipeline, since only the IF and ID stages would need to be flushed,
instead of the three stages in the preceding example.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.3.5.3. Dynamic Branch Prediction.</b> It would
be useful to be able to predict whether or not a majority of the
branches are taken or not taken.  This can be done in software, using
intelligent compilers, and can also be done at runtime.  We concentrate
on the software-intensive techniques first, since they are less expensive
to implement (being closer to the compiler, which is easier to modify
than the hardware).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The most advantageous situation is one where the branch
condition does not depend on instructions immemdiately preceding it, as
shown in the following code fragment:

</p><pre>     add $5, $5, $6     # One of the registers for beq comparison is modified
     sub $4, $3, $6     # Nothing important to the branch here
     and $7, $8, $6     # Nothing important to the branch here
     and $9, $6, $6     # Nothing important to the branch here
<b>     beq $5, $6,</b> target
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the branch compares Registers 5 and 6, which
are last modified in the <code>add</code> instruction.  We can
therefore precompute the branch condition as <code>sub r $5,
$6</code>, where <i>r</i> denotes a destination register.  If r = 0,
then we know the branch will be taken, and the runtime module
(pipeline loader) can schedule the jump to the branch target address
with full confidence that the branch will be taken.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Another approach is to keep a history of branch
statements, and to record what addresses these statements branch.
Since the vast majority of branches are used as tests of loop indices,
then we know that the branch will almost always jump to the loopback
point.  If the branch fails, then we know the loop is finished, and
this happens only once per loop.  Since most loops are designed to
have many iterations, branch failure occurs less frequently in loops
than does taking the branch.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, it makes good sense to assume that a branch
will jump to the place that it jumped to before.  However, in dense
decision structures (e.g., nested or cascaded <i>if</i> statements),
this situation does not always occur.  In such cases, one might not be
able to tell from the preceding branch whether or not the branching
behavior will be repeated.  It is then reasonable to use a
multi-branch lookahead.

discussion of multi-bit branch prediction schemes given on
pp. 501-502 of the textbook.</font>
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Another clever technique of making branches more
efficient is the <i>branch delay slot</i>.  We previously discussed
delayed branches when we overviewed the multicycle datapath
implementation of the <code>beq</code> instruction.  In summary, the
concept of efficient branching has two parts.  First, the branch
target address is computed in the ID stage of the pipeline, to
determine as early as possible the instruction to fetch if the branch
succeeds.  Since this is done in the second stage of the pipeline,
there is an instruction I following this (in the first or IF stage).
After I moves to the ID stage, then the branch target (pointed to
by either PC+4 or the BTA) is loaded into the IF stage.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">It is this instruction (I) that is called the
<i>branch delay slot</i> (BDS).  In the BDS can be safely placed an
instruction that does not have data dependencies with respect to (a)
the branch condition, (b) the instruction following the branch
condition, or (c) the branch target.  This ensures that, when the
instruction J is executed (J is the instruction to which control is
transferred after the branch condition is evaluated, whether J is
pointed to by PC+4 or BTA), then the instruction I will have been
executed previously, and the pipe will not have a stall where I would
have been.  As a result, the pipe will remain full throughout the
branch evaluation and execution, unless an exception occurs.

</p><h4>5.3.6. Exceptions as Hazards</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Hardware and software must work together in any
architecture, especially in a pipeline processor.  Here, the ISA and
processor control must be designed so that the following steps occur
when an exception is detected:

</p><p></p><ol><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Hardware detects an exception (e.g.,
       overflow in the ALU) and stops the offending instruction at the
       EX stage. 

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Pipeline loader and scheduler allow all prior
       instructions (e.g., those already in the pipeline in MEM and
       WB) to complete.

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">All instructions that are present in the
       pipeline after the exception is detected are flushed from the
       pipeline.

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">The address of the offending instruction
       (usually the address in main memory) is saved in the EPC register,
       and a code describing the exception is saved in the Cause register.

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Hardware control branches to the exception
       handling routine (part of the operating system).

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">The exception handler performs one of three
       actions: (1) notify the user of the exception (e.g., divide-by-zero
       or arithmetic-overflow) then terminate the program; (2) try to
       correct or mitigate the exception then restart the offending
       instruction; or (3) if the exception is a benign interrupt (e.g.,
       an I/O request), then save the program/pipeline state, service the
       interrupt request, then restart the program at the instruction 
       pointed to by EPC + 4.
</p></li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In any case, the pipeline is flushed as described.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In general, we can say that, if a pipeline has N
segments, and the EX stage is at segment 1 &lt; i &lt; N, then two
observations are key to the prediction of pipeline performance:

</p><p></p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Flushing</i> negates the processing of
       the (i-1) instructions following the offending instruction.
       These must be reloaded into the pipe, at the cost of i cycles
       (one cycle to flush, i-1 cycles to reload the i-1 instructions
       <i>after</i> the exception is processed).

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Completing</i> the N-i instructions that
       were loaded into the pipeline prior to the offending
       instruction takes N-i clock cycles, which are executed (a)
       prior to, or (b) concurrently with, the reloading of the
       instructions i-1 that followed the i-th instruction (in the EX
       stage).
</p></li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is readily seen that the total number of wasted
cycles equals (i-1) + (N-i) = N - 1, which is precisely the number
of cycles that it takes to set up or reload the pipeline.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The proliferation of unproductive cycles
can be mitigated by the following technique:

</p><p></p><ol><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Freeze the pipeline state as soon as an
       exception is detected.  

</p><p>    </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Process the exception via the exception
       handler, and decide whether or not to halt or restart the
       pipeline.

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">If the pipeline is restarted, reload the
       (i-1) instructions following the offending instruction,
       concurrently with completing execution of the (N-i)
       instructions that were being processed prior to the offending
       instruction.
</p></li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If Step 3 can be performed as stated, then the
best-case penalty is only one cycle, plus the time incurred by
executing the exception handler.  If the entire pipeline needs to be
flushed and restarted, then the worst-case penalty is N cycles
incurred by flushing the pipe, then reloading the pipeline
<i>after</i> the instructions preceding the offending instruction have
been executed.  If the offending instruction must be restarted, then a
maximum of <i>i</i> cycles are lost (one cycle for flush, plus (i-1)
cycles to restart the instructions in the pipe following the offending
instruction).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In the next section, we collect the concepts about
pipeline performance that we have been discussing, and show how to
compute the CPI for a pipeline processor under constraint of stalls,
structural hazards, branch penalties, and exception penalties.

</p><h3>5.4. Pipeline Performance Analysis</h3>

<a name="Sec5.4"></a>
<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec5.4"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">As we said early on in this course, we are trying to
teach the technique of <i>performance analysis</i>, which helps one to
intelligently determine whether or not a given processor is suitable
computationally for a specific application.  In this section, we
develop performance equations for a pipeline processor, and do so in a
stepwise way, so you can see how the various hazards and penalties
affect performance.

</p><h4>5.4.1. CPI of a Pipeline Processor</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Suppose an N-segment pipeline processes M instructions 
without stalls or penalties.  We know that it takes N-1 cycles to load
(setup) the pipeline, and M cycles to complete the instructions.  Thus,
the number of cycles is given by:

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = N + M - 1 .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The cycles per instruction are easily computed:

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + (N - 1)/M .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, CPI for a finite program will always be greater
than one.  This stands in sharp contradiction to the first fallacy of 
pipeline processing, which says:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Fallacy #1:</b> <i>CPI of a pipeline processor is
always equal to 1.0, since one instruction is processed per cycle.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This statement is fallacious because it ignores the
overhead that we have just discussed.  The fallacy is similar to
claiming that you only spend eight hours at the office each day, so
you must have 16 hours per day of "fun time".  However, you have to
take time to commute to/from the office, buy groceries, and do all the
other homely tasks of life, many of which are in no way related to
"fun time".  In practice, such tasks are drudgery that is a type of
overhead.

</p><h4>5.4.2. Effect of Stalls</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Now let us add some stalls to the pipeline processing
scheme.  Suppose that we have a N-segment pipeline processing M
instructions, and we must insert K stalls to resolve data dependencies.
This means that the pipeline now has a setup penalty of N-1 cycles,
as before, a stall penalty of K cycles, and a processing cost (as before)
of M cycles to process the M instructions.  Thus, our governing equations
become:

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = N + M + K - 1 .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">and

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + (N + K - 1)/M .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In practice, what does this tell us?  Namely, that
the stall penalty (and all the other penalties that we will examine)
adversely impact CPI.  Here is an example to show how we would analyze
the problem of stalls in a pipelined program where the percentage of
instructions that incur stalls versus non-stalls are specified.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example.</b> Suppose that an N-segment pipeline
executes M instructions, and that a fraction f<sub>stall</sub> of the
instructions require the insertion of K stalls per instruction to
resolve data dependencies.  The total number of stalls is given by
f<sub>stall</sub> ยท M ยท K (fraction of instructions that are
stalls, times the total number of instructions, times the average number
of stalls per instruction).  By substitution, our preceding equations
for pipeline performance become:

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = N + M + (f<sub>stall</sub> ยท M ยท K) - 1 .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">and

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + (f<sub>stall</sub> ยท K) + (N - 1)/M .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">So, the CPI penalty due to the combined effects of
setup cost and stalls now increases to fK + (N - 1)/M.  If
f<sub>stall</sub> = 0.1, K = 3, N = 5, and M = 100, then CPI = 1 + 0.3
+ 4/100 = 1.34, which is 34 percent larger than the fallacious
assumption of CPI = 1.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This leads to the next fallacy of pipeline processing:

</p><blockquote><b>Fallacy #2:</b> <i>Stalls are not a big problem with
pipelines - you only have to worry about the number of stalls, not
the percentage of instructions that induce stalls.</i>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This fallacy is particularly dangerous.  It is
analogous to saying that the only thing that matters is the number of
home burglaries each year, not the burglary rate per capita.  If you
move to a new neighborhood, you want to know <i>both</i> the number
and per-capita incidence of crimes in that neighborhood, not just the
robbery count.  Then you can determine, from the population, whether
or not it is safe to live there.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Similarly, with a pipeline processor, you want to
determine whether or not the instruction mix or ordering of
instructions causes data dependencies, and what is the incidence of
such dependencies.  For example, 1,000 instruction program with 20
stalls will run more efficiently than a 1,000 instruction program with
20 percent of the instructions requiring one stall each to resolve
dependencies.

</p><h4>5.4.3. Effect of Exceptions</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">For purposes of discussion, assume that we have M
instructions executing on an N-segment pipeline with no stalls, but
that a fraction f<sub>ex</sub> of the instructions raise an exception
in the EX stage.  Further assume that each exception requires that (a)
the pipeline segments before the EX stage be flushed, (b) that the
exception be handled, requiring an average of H cycles per exception,
then that (c) the instruction causing the exception and its following
instructions be reloaded into the pipeline.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, f<sub>ex</sub> ยท M instructions will cause
exceptions.  In the MIPS pipeline, each of these instructions causes
three instructions to be flushed out of the pipe (IF, ID, and EX
stages), which incurs a penalty of four cycles (one cycle to flush,
and three to reload) plus H cycles to handle the exception. Thus,
the pipeline performance equations become:

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = N - 1 + (1 - f<sub>ex</sub>) ยท M + (f<sub>ex</sub> ยท M ยท (H + 4)) ,</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">which we can rewrite as

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = M + [N - 1 - M + (1 - f<sub>ex</sub>) ยท M + (f<sub>ex</sub> ยท M ยท (H + 4))] .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Rearranging terms, the equation for CPI can be
expressed as

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + [1 - f<sub>ex</sub> + (f<sub>ex</sub> ยท (H+4)) - 1 + (N - 1)/M] .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">After combining terms, this becomes:

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + [(f<sub>ex</sub> ยท (H+3)) + (N - 1)/M] .</p>


<p align="JUSTIFY">We can see by examination of this equation and the
expression for CPI due to stalls that exceptions have a more
detrimental effect, for two reasons.  First, the overhead for stalls
(K stalls per affected instruction) is K &lt; 4 cycles in the MIPS
pipeline (since the pipeline has only five segments).  Second, the
cost of each exception is H+3 cycles per affected instruction.  Since
H &gt; 0 for a nontrivial exception handler, the cost of an exception in
the MIPS pipeline (under the preceding assumptions) will exceed the
cost of remedying a hazard using stalls.  The good news, however, is
that there are usually fewer exceptions in programs than data or
structural dependencies, with the exception of I/O-intensive programs
(many I/O interrupts) and arithmetic-intensive programs (possible
overflow or underflow exceptions).

</p><h4>5.4.4. Effect of Branches</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Branches present a more complex picture in pipeline
performance analysis.  Recall that there are three ways of dealing
with a branch: (1) Assume the branch is not taken, and if the branch
is taken, flush the instructions in the pipe after the branch, then
insert the instruction pointed to by the BTA; (2) the converse of 1);
and (3) use a delayed branch with a branch delay slot and re-ordering
of code (assuming that this can be done).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The first two cases are symmetric.  Assume that an
error in branch prediction (i.e., taking the branch when you expected
not to, and conversely) requires L instruction to be flushed from the
pipeline (one cycle for flushing plus L-1 "dead" cycles, since the
branch target can be inserted in the IF stage).  Thus, the cost of
each branch prediction error is L cycles.  Further assume that 
a fraction f<sub>br</sub> of the instructions are branches and
f<sub>be</sub> of these instructions result in branch prediction
errors.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The penalty in cycles for branch prediction
errors is thus given by

</p><p align="CENTER"><i>branch_penalty</i> = f<sub>br</sub> ยท
f<sub>be</sub> ยท M instructions ยท L cycles per instruction .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The pipeline performance equations then become:

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = N - 1 + (1 - f<sub>br</sub> ยท
f<sub>be</sub>) ยท M + (f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub> ยท M ยท L) ,</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">which we can rewrite as

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = M + [N - 1 - M + (1 - f<sub>br</sub> ยท
f<sub>be</sub>) ยท M + (f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub> ยท M ยท L) ,</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Rearranging terms, the equation for CPI can be
expressed as

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + [(1 - f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub>) + (f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub> ยท L) - 1 + (N - 1)/M] .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">After combining terms, this becomes:

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + [(f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub> ยท (L-1)) + (N - 1)/M] .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the case of the branch delay slot, we assume that
the branch target address is computed and the branch condition is
evaluated at the ID stage.  Thus, if the branch prediction is correct,
there is no penalty.  Depending on the method by which the pipeline
evaluates the branch and fetches (or pre-fetches) the branch target, a
maximum of two cycles penalty (one cycle for flushing, one cycle for
fetching and inserting the branch target) is incurred for insertion of
a stall in the case of a branch prediction error.  In this case, the
pipeline performance equations become:

</p><p align="CENTER">N<sub>cyc</sub> = N - 1 + (1 - f<sub>br</sub> ยท
f<sub>be</sub>) ยท M + (f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub> ยท 2M) ,</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">which implies the following equation for CPI as a
function of branches and branch prediction errors:

</p><p align="CENTER">CPI = N<sub>cyc</sub>/M = 1 + [f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub> + (N - 1)/M] .</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Since f<sub>br</sub> &lt;&lt; 1 is usual, and
f<sub>be</sub> is, on average, assumed to be no worse than 0.5, the
product f<sub>br</sub> ยท f<sub>be</sub>, which represents the
additional branch penalty for CPI in the presence of delayed branch
and BDS, is generally small.

</p><p align="CENTER">_______________<sub>//</sub>_______________</p>

We next concentrate on the discussion and analysis of supporting
technologies, such as memories and buses.
